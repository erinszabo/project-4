# Nose tests #

Write 5 test cases for `../acp_times.py` in `test_acp_times.py`. Remeber: you have to write them based on the original website.

Also remember you must run the tests from the parent directory to access `acp_times`. You can just use `run_tests.sh` for that, like in project 3.

## Setup

Jump into your container and run `./run_tests.sh`.

```shell
docker exec -it YOUR_CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
```

Note that you should not enter the tests directory, `run_tests.sh` will take care of everything.
